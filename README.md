# kanbas-react-web-app

This project is a React.js-based web application that implements an Online Learning Management System (OLMS) inspired by Canvas. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate skills in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on building user interfaces with React.js.

## Features

- **React.js**: The application is built using React.js to manage the UI components.
- **HTML & CSS**: HTML is used for structuring content, and CSS will be applied later to style the web pages.
- **User Management**: Implements basic user account screens like sign in, sign up, and profile management.
- **Kanbas Dashboard**: Displays a list of courses a user is enrolled in or teaching.
- **Course Navigation**: Allows navigation between different course content such as modules, assignments, and quizzes.
